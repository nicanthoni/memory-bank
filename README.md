# Sandbox-v1

## Description

This sabdbox-v1 repository was created for me to begin my first personal project. I've decided to create a memory bank/scrapbook website of sorts to host memories and photos of my partner and I. With us being in a long distance relationship, the memories we carry through photos & videos hold a lot of importance to us.
