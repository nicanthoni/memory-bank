# memory-bank

This repository was created for me to begin my first personal project. I've decided to create a memory bank/scrapbook website of sorts to host memories and photos of my partner and I. I plan to add javascript functionality that will allow us to input a new memory via text/photo, log it somewhere, and use that to add more memory content. With us being in a long distance relationship, the memories we carry through photos & videos hold a lot of importance to us.
