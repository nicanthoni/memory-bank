    <h1>Nic & Libby's Scrapbook</h1>
    <p> <em>As I'm learning how to build my first website for my first personal project, I found myself constantly thinking about all the fun we've had in such a short amount of time. So, through a change of plans, I wanted to make my first project a scrapbook just for us. Here we can store our favorite memories & photos; I plan to add to this <strong>many, many more times</strong> as we continue making memories.</em></p>
